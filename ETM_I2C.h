  This function sets up the selected i2c_port with the configuation parameter that is passed in.
  It also calculates the baud rate register based on the selected baud rate and the system clock.
  pulse_gobbler_delay_fcy is the inverse of the pulse_gobbler_delay.  Good luck finding this on the data sheet
  Typical values range from 100ns - 900ns
